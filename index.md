## HC3 Summary
When researching the NYC Clean Heat Program we learned about how the program was initiated to help NYC buildings become more green and energy efficient. We learned how harmful fuel 4 and fuel 6 can be to the environment and how the program has measures to limit the use of these fuels. We also learned about the DEP Boiler Registration which forces any new boiler system registered with NYC DEP to be put into a triennial cycle of registration. Lastly, we learned about the Greener Greater Buildings plan which is a set of energy laws and initiatives aimed at improving the energy efficiency of NYC buildings.
